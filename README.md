## 🍽🌟 Exciting news for foodies and data enthusiasts! I used the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset to predict restaurant success, and here are the steps I took:

**👉 Business and data understanding**

**👉 Check datatype with df.info()**

**👉 Remove duplicates**

**👉 Univariate analysis to check for errors**

**👉 Clean data using apply and try-except**

**👉 Feature engineering**

**👉 Question analysis**

**👉 Encode data using One_hot and Binary_Encoder**

**👉 Create pipeline and use precision score to evaluate different models (LR, KNN, RF, XG, CART)**

**👉 Choose best model (XG) and apply GridSearch to fine-tune**

**👉 Deploy project using Streamlit**
